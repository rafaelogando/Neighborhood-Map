Note: Attached will be a folder called "OriginalFiles" wich include the no minified or modified page. It has the page state before using Gulp tools on it.

Did not forget CDN precached adventage but not implemented this time. 

I notice there are lot of inprovements that can be done here but right now it will be too hard to get the time to work on those improvements.
